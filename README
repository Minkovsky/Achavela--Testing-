This is a testing repository for the Achavela Project, which contains the really low-level tests, for example battle algorithms test programs and other stuff (mostly bugged). It will NOT contain any full-blown releases (nor alphas, nor betas. but you can hope for a pre-alpha every now and then), just some test stuff.
